# GrassChann

A high-performance proxy sender written in Go, designed for managing multiple proxy connections to Grass ecosystem through WebSocket. Experience blazing-fast connectivity with optimized connection pooling, smart proxy distribution, and rock-solid stability. Built with FastHTTP for lightning-quick proxy verification and Gorilla WebSocket for unbreakable server connections.

## ‚ö° Key Features

- High throughput proxy connection management
- Smart proxy rotation and auto-distribution
- Real-time connection monitoring
- Proxy health verification via ipinfo.io
- Connection pooling with FastHTTP
- Beautiful logging with Charmbracelet's Log & Lipgloss
- Memory-efficient resource management
- Graceful shutdown handling

## üî• Performance Highlights
- Lightning-fast connection establishment
